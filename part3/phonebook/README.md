This project requires Node.js and npm to be installed on your system. You can download them from the official website: https://nodejs.org/en/download or install it by using your package manager.

Once installed, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the following command to install the project's dependencies:

```
npm install
```
There are two ways to run the application:

To start the application in production mode, run the following command:

```
npm start
```

This will start the application server and make it accessible on the defined port (usually specified in the project configuration).


To start the application in development mode with automatic server restarts on file changes, run the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

This is recommended for development as it allows for a more seamless and efficient workflow without needing to manually restart the server after every code change.
